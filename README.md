# Overview
The Fully Homomorphic Encryption is the most advanced cryptographic encryption being used in Web3. Developed by ZAMA, it is the foundational algorithm for HTTPZ, the next-gen HTTPS for fully encrypted Web3 communication. This project is a simulation of using FHE to encrypt Agent2Agent Protocol which is the standard method of communication for AI agents, services, and LLMs. AI Agents currently use text or JSON format to communicate which poses risks of security and privacy. FHE solves it by encrypting the entire message and allowing the Agents to perform operations without decrypting the message.

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js
